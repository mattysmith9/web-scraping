Pay Rate:  to $40.00 per hour w2 (without benefits) or $50.00 corp to corp per hour

This is an exciting opportunity to work in Lexington, MA with a leader in the healthcare industry!  Our client is looking to hire a QA Engineer to work alongside other Quality Assurance professionals. 

About the QA Engineer job:

- Writing test plans and test cases
- Web testing experience
- Must have at least intermediate SQL experience with a familiarity joining tables.  The SQL editors our client uses are Toad (for Oracle) and SQL Developer, although anyone familiar with other editors could easily learn to use these editors.  Also, someone with SQL Server experience could transfer their knowledge to Oracle.
Some automation experience would be a plus, but not required at this early stage.  For now, it is primarily running scripts, but modifying them is planned down the road.  The tool used is HP UFT, formerly known as QTP (Quick Test Professional).
- As far as XML files are concerned, they just use them to check the data output.  No special knowledge of or manipulating of XML is required.
- Bugs (defects) and test cases are logged to HP ALM (Quality Center), but this can be picked up in a few days and would not be a pre-requisite.
- Typically, QA is given either a business requirements document, but more normally a functional spec document and sometimes a technical spec document, which are reviewed at meetings with development.  Then, from these documents, test cases are written and reviewed.  The code is deployed, tested, and bugs logged.  After the QA sign-off generally a User Acceptance Test (UAT) is done, but in this case the users don’t do back end testing, so that QA presents the test results at a meeting instead.
- A lot of data analysis is involved, looking through the data to test.  And if these can’t be found, then QA helps developers to find suitable info that can be modified (mocked-up) for the tests and may write a simple script.  But QA does not run these scripts – that is done by the developers and DBAs.
- Finally, the plan is to not do so many mockups, but instead input the data in the front ends to the data warehouse.     ",,$40.00 per hour w2 (without benefits) or $50.00 corp to corp per hour

SBIR FUNDING provides a team of experienced professionals who can assist with application for SBIR Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 grants as well as the administration of each award.  

We are seeking a software/systems/electronics/AI/biotech-medtech inventor possessing a unique product idea that requires  funding to commercialize.  Ideally, you are a student or professor who may not have the resources or time to take an idea forward and who seeks a team to help advance the idea to commercialization via federal SBIR seed funding program.   

SBIR is the Small Business Innovation Research program, a federally  funded alternative to raising venture or angel funding.  It is a government seed/grant program begun in 1982 that typically is awarded in 3  phases:  

1 ) Phase 1 – Up to $150-225K in non-dilutive funds for development of a prototype or proof of concept (6 months) 
2 ) Phase 2 – Up to $1-1.5M for implementation of commercialization of product (2 years) 
3 ) Phase 3 – Marketing stage development for the product  

A study commissioned by the National Academy of Sciences indicated that “SBIR awards provided $2.3B in research and seed funding in 2007.  In comparison, private venture markets provided $1.2B in seed stage funding (that year).”

The application and selection process is rigorous and money is awarded is allocated from 2.5% of 11 federal agencies’ external R&D budgets to fund R&D projects by small businesses to meet mission needs and commercialize the results of federally funded research.  A detailed summary of the program can  be found here:  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business_Innovation_Research 

A detailed list of the participating agencies can be found here:

https://www.sbir.gov/about/about-sbir 

Approximately 30,000 applications are received annually for the DoD  SBIR with a 10% award success.  In 2004, the NIH awarded roughly 30% of Phase 1 grant applications.  This compares to a 2%  success rate which is typical for angel investors.  

The benefit of going  this route is that you do not have to give up a sizable share of equity as you might with VC or angel investment, and you do not have the repay the grant.  

Companies that have gone on to become successful having first applied  for SBIR funding include: Genzyme, Genentech, Amgen, Kurtzweil, Cubist, Vertex, et al.  

The trade off is that the application for SBIR funding is not easy.   Typically there is a 9-12 month review period from the time you submit  your application until a Phase 1 decision is made.  There is no cost to  submit a proposal but the paperwork and online systems setup required for the application process is tedious and exhaustive.  Without an  appropriate background, team and network of industry peer contacts to review and support your application, it is a difficult path to pursue.  

We are a team of experienced former gov’t researchers, entrepreneurs,  programmers, and consultants who are familiar with SBIR process and who  can provide support for an SBIR application, administration of the SBIR award and product development process to bring your idea to market.    

We can provide a primary investigator, a > 50% full time employee  required by SBIR grants, as well as support team to ensure successful  application and execution of a Phase 1 award. We can also help with the  application / execution of Phase 2 and Phase 3 awards.  In this manner,  you can focus your efforts on the key research or technical work to be  done as part of this project and not have to contend with the massive  reporting requirements that goes along with an award.  

You should ideally possess a unique idea, one that addresses a problem  for which no solution currently exists.  For example, a health or military related device or tool, product idea, software and/or electronic device (ie, IoT sensor/device, health related device/system, machine learning system, AI, Echo/Alexa, biotech, etc.).     Ideally, you  should also have developed a working prototype/POC of the product.   

As we are only able to work on one project at any given time, we are currently accepting new submissions for projects that have strong potential for  successful commercialization.  If we feel your product idea is a fit, we can agree to sign an NDA and determine whether an appropriate SBIR  request for proposal exists for your product.   Ultimately, if we feel  the project is worthy and worth pursuing we will offer a proposal  revenue/profit sharing agreement that is fair to both parties.    ",,TBD

Clinical Research IO (CRIO) is a fast-moving start-up company in Kendall Square working to transform the clinical research industry with the latest in cloud and tablet technology. We’re looking for a savvy, detail-oriented software development intern to help us build our next generation product.
Even in an age of smart-phones, most clinical research today is hand-written on paper and stored in clunky binders. Our system allows doctors and study coordinators to enter that same information into an interactive, easy-to-use tablet application.  Clinical research is accelerated and made more efficient.   As a result, potentially life-saving drugs and medical devices can be FDA approved and reach those who need it faster.

As a software development intern, you will be responsible for developing core features of our product using Java, MySql, HTML5, JQuery, Android, IOS/Swift and other cutting technologies.   You'll be working hard for sure, but you'll also learn a tremendous amount and get to experience the joys and challenges of working in a fast-paced and highly entrepreneurial internet company.  

If you consider yourself in the top %1, then please send your resume and why you think you would be good a fit for us.  Both current students and recent graduates are welcomed to apply.

Do you have a few years of experience as a Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM®) under your belt? Does your project management experience run the gamut from traditional waterfall methodology to an Agile environment? Our 50-person Project Management Office team in Technology is looking for a scrum master: someone with the flexibility to work collaboratively and independently and who can be persuasive, motivating, and attentive to detail—while always keeping an eye on the big picture. Does that sound like you? Our scrum master will be working with multiple teams simultaneously, so a can-do attitude and the ability to handle several projects at once are essential qualities. 


Key responsibilities

Guiding the team on how to use Agile/Scrum practices and values while maintaining the Commonwealth culture and spirit
Facilitating Scrum meetings
Supporting the team through a servant leadership style
Working with the team and any external resources to help identify impediments and remove them
Facilitating communication with other teams as needed to address any cross-team dependencies
Monitoring progress against Commonwealth operational metrics
Working with the product owner to establish and review team-specific metrics designed to improve team performance (in addition to Commonwealth operational metrics)
Gaining a high-level understanding of the application(s) to the extent useful in serving other scrum master responsibilities
Participating with the product owner and business analyst in discussions around strategic planning, including vision, goals, and road maps
Ensuring that the team has the resources (i.e., people and tools) necessary for success
Organizing Agile/Scrum training workshops as needed
Attending the weekly scrum master “Scrum of Scrums” to report on team activities
Providing traditional project management support for projects as needed

Core strengths

3–5 years of experience as a scrum master; CSM® certification is a must
A strong desire to help the team succeed and do what is necessary to make it happen
Ability to work on multiple Scrum teams concurrently (usually no more than two)
Experience working independently, as well as in a team-oriented collaborative environment
Strong, clear communication skills (written, verbal, and presentation)
Ability to conform to shifting priorities, demands, and timelines through analytical and problem-solving capabilities
Persuasive, adaptable, encouraging, and motivating
An independent learner and self-starter
An eye for detail but able to see the big picture

While not required, experience with the following would be a plus:

Experience working with multiple Scrum teams on a single project
2-5 years of project management experience
A background in financial services


Have we piqued your curiosity? Can you see yourself thriving in this opportunity? Let's introduce ourselves.
